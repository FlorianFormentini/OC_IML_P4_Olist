# OpenClassrooms IML - Project 4 : OLIST

OLIST, an online marketplace sales platform, wants to segment their customers.  
My task is to understand the different types of users through their behaviour and personal data.

The marketing team needs a description of the segmentation and its underlying logic for optimal use, as well as a proposal for a maintenance contract based on an analysis of segment stability over time.

## Data
Olist has provided an anonymised database with information on order history, products purchased, satisfaction comments, and customer location since January 2017.
